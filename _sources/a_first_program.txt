A First Program
===============
A guide to a programming language would be incomplete without at least one complete program and since Wasabi is intimately tied to generating web pages here's a Wasabi program for generating a simple HTML page::

	<% 
	<WebEntryPoint("example.asp")> _
	Sub Example()
	  %>
	  <!DOCTYPE html>
	  <html>
	    <head>
	      <title>An Example Wasabi Program</title>
	      <meta charset="utf-8">
	    </head>
	    <body>
	      <h1>An Example Wasabi Program</h1>
	      <p>Arithmetic: 1 + 1 = <%= 1 + 1 %></p>
	      <p>Dynamic Content: x + y = <%= IntRequest("x") + IntRequest("y") %>
	    </body>
	  </html>
	  <%
	End Sub
	%>

A couple of interesting things about this program:

1. The entire thing is enclosed in tie-fighters (:token:`<%` :token:`%>`). This is a consequence of it's classic ASP heritage where each file was assumed to be generating a web page and so FogBugz's entire Wasabi code base lives inside :token:`<%` and :token:`%>` so it's not dumped directly to the response.

2. ``<WebEntryPoint("example.asp")>`` is an annotation that marks the following subroutine as generating a web page at ``/example.asp``.

3. [1] combined with [2] result in actual content destined for the response being wrapped in reverse-tie-fighters (:token:`%>` :token:`<%`) with dynamic content being injected with :token:`<%=` :token:`%>`.
